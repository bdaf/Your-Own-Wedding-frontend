## Self-esteem
From my point of view application is very simple and intuitive for the users. Allows to comfy manage list of guests and plan events regarding wedding ceremony. Finding proper wedding service offers is also very friendly for the users. Publishing offers for service providers is easy and simple. They also can use planning events with notes feature. Using these notes as a todo tasks is very handy.
